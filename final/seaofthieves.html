        <h2>Ultimate Mission</h2>
    <p>As the ultimate goal of the game can be argued to be whatever the player wants it to be, the most common goal among players is to become a legend of the seas and bathe in the riches that come with it.</p>

    <h3>Balance</h3>
    <p>Some may be wondering about where balance plays an effect in the game. Sea of Theieves has many different ways in which they balance the game including the weapons being the same and doing the same damage amongst all players. Ship Combat varies however due to the fact that the players ships range from a two man ship to a four man ship. Although a two man ship sounds like a disadvantage, two man ships are much faster but contain less firepower.</p>

<h3>Visual Aesthetic</h3>
<ul>
<p>One of the most respected parts of the game is it's stunning setting. The view of the sunset from aboard your ship to the heavy rain and intense waves really tie the game together and encapsulate the player into the true pirate experience. </p>
