    <h3>Pirate v.s. Pirate Combat</h3>
    <p>Something to keep in mind for new players is Pirate vs Pirate combat. As it can be quite frustrating at first, being able to dominate in off-ship combat is a must. Given the skill gap it, isn't easy to learn quickly. However over time it makes more and more sense allowing you to rule the seas! </p>

    <h3>Sea Monsters</h3>
    <p>Yes you heard that right, SEA MONSTERS!!!. On top of all the craziness that occurs on the seas, two sea monsters roam the waters. The Kraken and The Megaladon lurk in the depths patiently waiting for the opporotunity to attack your ship. The Kraken attacks and turns all the water in the area black warning the player of it's intentions. The Kraken is a more rare encounter than the Megaladon however you have the ability to defeat both. The Megaladon gives no warning and does less damage, however, it is important to stay on your ship and DO NOT fall off. </p>

<h3>Health and Consumables</h3>
<ul>
<p>Keeping your pirate's health at it's maximum is crucial to not winding up on the ferry of the dammed. Always remember to find and collect food items and use them! Food can be obtained by barrels on islands or out at sea or the player has the option to fish and catch their food. </p>
