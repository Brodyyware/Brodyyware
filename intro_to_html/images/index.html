    <h1>Ramble On</h1>
    <p>Diving into the works of Led Zeppelin, we are gonna look at some of Zeppelin's greatest hits. Starting with Ramble On, it is clear in their playing that the band is heavily influenced by blues, rock, and even some folk music. I would say that the most notable aspect of this song is the powerful drumming from John Bonham. John Bonham is regarded as one of the best and most heavy hitting drummers of all time. One thing that makes almost any Zeppelin track memorable is the lead singer Robert Plants lyrical ability. Most songs involve fantasy-inspired imagery to help them better capture the reoccuring themes of adventutre, love, and longing.</p>

    <h2>Stairway to heaven</h2>
    <p>Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven" is an iconic rock ballad released in 1971 in their album "Led Zeppelin IV". The song is known for its intricate guitar work, haunting lyrics, and dynamic progression. The guitar solo performed by guitarist Jimmy Page is regarded as one of, if not the best guitar solo in history. </p>
